# Traffic Shock Wave Simulation

This project simulates traffic shock waves that occur when vehicles slow down and then speed up again. The simulation visually represents how traffic jams form, propagate, and dissipate, demonstrating the phenomenon known as a "traffic shock wave."

## Files

- **New.html**: Contains the complete HTML and JavaScript code for the traffic shock wave simulation, including the structure for the simulation interface, styles for the elements, and the logic for simulating traffic behavior.

## Features

- Realistic acceleration and deceleration behaviors based on vehicle spacing.
- Color-coded vehicles that visually represent their current speed state.
- Adjustable parameters to experiment with different traffic conditions.
- Statistics showing the average speed and flow rate in each lane.
- Options to highlight the jam wave front and show speed indicators.

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Open the `New.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the controls to start, stop, and reset the simulation.
3. Adjust the sliders to change the number of cars, initial speed, jam propagation delay, and braking force.
4. Observe the behavior of the cars as they react to the simulated traffic conditions.

## About Traffic Shock Waves

Traffic shock waves occur when vehicles slow down due to various factors, such as congestion or obstacles. This simulation allows users to visualize how these waves propagate through traffic, affecting the speed and flow of vehicles.
